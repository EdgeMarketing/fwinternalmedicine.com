            Fort Worth’s premier internal medicine practice
          </h2>
          <p>
            Fort Worth Internal Medicine was founded in the 1980s by Dr. Craig Dearden and has been led by Dr. Mark Ziats since 2024. Dr. Ziats took over the practice because he is inspired to help adult patients in the Fort Worth area with chronic medical issues and preventive care.
          </p>

          <p>
            Under his leadership, the practice remains the top internal medicine office in Fort Worth, providing exceptional patient care and a smooth patient experience that we have continually enhanced through improved efficiency and greater availability. We have introduced new proactive genomic testing and other advanced preventive medicine services for our patients.

            We have designed an office that makes our patients feel comfortable and assembled a team of friendly professionals who support the traditional family-like environment we've built. Our increased availability for patients means longer appointment times (30 minutes for follow-up visits), allowing us to listen to and understand all your concerns and take the time to address them properly.
